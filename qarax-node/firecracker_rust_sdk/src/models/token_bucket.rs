/// TokenBucket : Defines a token bucket with a maximum capacity (size), an initial burst size (one_time_burst) and an interval for refilling purposes (refill_time). The refill-rate is derived from size and refill_time, and it is the constant rate at which the tokens replenish. The refill process only starts happening after the initial burst budget is consumed. Consumption from the token bucket is unbounded in speed which allows for bursts bound in size by the amount of tokens available. Once the token bucket is empty, consumption speed is bound by the refill_rate.
